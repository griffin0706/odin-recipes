    <h2>Ingredients for Sinigang na Baka</h2>
    <p>Here’s what you’ll need, and why each ingredient matters:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 lbs beef neck bones: These create a rich, meaty broth and give the soup deep flavor. The meat also becomes tender after slow cooking.</li>
        <li>50 grams tamarind soup mix (Maggi Magic Sinigang): This gives the soup its signature sour flavor with just the right amount of tang.</li>
        <li>15 green beans, cut into 2 inch pieces: These add color and crunch, and they hold up well in the broth.</li>
        <li>5 taro roots, peeled: Taro helps thicken the soup slightly and turns soft and creamy as it cooks.</li>
        <li>2 Chinese eggplants, sliced diagonally: Eggplant becomes tender and absorbs the flavor of the broth nicely.</li>
        <li>3 long green peppers: These add aroma and just a touch of heat that enhances the overall flavor.</li>
        <li>10 pieces okra: Okra adds a slightly earthy note and contributes to the thickness of the soup.
</li>
        <li>1 white radish (daikon): This adds a mild sweetness and balances out the sourness of the broth.</li>
        <li>4 plum tomatoes, wedged: Tomatoes boost the savory and slightly tangy taste of the broth.</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced: Garlic lays down the base flavor and brings a warm aroma to the soup.</li>
        <li>3 onions, wedged: Onions give a subtle sweetness and add depth to the broth.</li>
        <li>1 quart rice water: This adds body to the broth and is a traditional base for many Filipino soups.</li>
        <li>1 quart water: Helps adjust the volume of the soup as it simmers.</li>
        <li>1 bunch water spinach:  These cook quickly and bring a fresh, slightly earthy flavor to the finished dish.</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon beef powder: Enhances the overall flavor of the soup and gives it a savory boost.</li>
        <li>Fish sauce: Used for seasoning. It adds salt and depth to the broth.</li>       
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Cook Sinigang na Baka</h2>
    <p>Let’s break this down into six easy steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauté the aromatics – In a large pot, heat some oil and sauté the garlic, onions, and half of the tomatoes. Cook until the onions soften. This is your flavor base.</li>
        <li>Brown the beef – Add the beef neck bones and cook until the outer part starts to brown. This step helps bring out the beef flavor early.</li>
        <li>Simmer with rice water – Pour in the rice water and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, lower the heat and let it simmer until the meat becomes very tender. Skim off any foam or impurities from the top.</li>
        <li>Add the souring mix and root vegetables – Stir in the tamarind soup mix and beef powder. Add the taro and white radish. Let everything cook until the taro is soft.</li>
        <li>Add more vegetables – Add the rest of the tomatoes, the eggplant, and the green peppers. Let this cook for about 5 minutes. Then add the okra and green beans and simmer for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Season and finish with leafy greens – Season the broth with fish sauce. Add the water spinach leaves last, letting them wilt for about a minute. Serve hot with steamed white rice.</li>
    </ol>
